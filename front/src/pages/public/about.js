        <p id="about-mission-text">
            Investing shouldn't mean juggling ten different platforms. Between brokers, social networks
            and streaming channels, useful information is scattered everywhere. Trader Tracker brings
            market data, price tracking and analyst recommendations together in a single, simple place,
            so investors can make informed decisions without the noise.
